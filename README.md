# Simple onepage schema website for startup's and others businesses which want to present their products or services.

### This was my `first experience` with create custom webpage base on `HTML`, `CSS` and `some Javascript`

I mostly use `grid` in my `css style` to make layout my webpage, to do some practise.

Use some `Javascript` to change navigation menu - add hamburger menu with `click event`.

Add `media-queries` to do some practise with responsive web design - `RWD`.
